Greetings, 

Attached is the preliminary Special Education Case Manager Additional Pay IEP Compliance Rate data for your school.

Please review the expired IEP and spelling of each case manager’s name with the designated staff. Any error must be corrected in Infinite Campus no later than May 25, 2022 when the official data will be pulled.

The errors are as follows:

IEP End Date column: If the date is highlighted in pink, the IEP has expired. If the date is highlighted in yellow, the IEP will expire prior to 5/25/2022.

Case Manager column: If the cell is red, there is no active case manager listed in the Case Manager tab.

Team Member Tab Case Manager column: If the cell is red, there is no active case manager identified in the Team Members tab.

Case Manager Match column: If “N” appears in the column, the case manager in the Team Members tab and the Case Manager tab do not match.

Please forward to your case managers for correction. They may view their compliance rate by referring to the Compliance column. Any compliance rates under 95% are highlighted in pink.

Please call the SEMS HelpDesk at (702) 799-0295 for further assistance.
