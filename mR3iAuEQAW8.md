Greetings, 

 

 

Per the Special Education Case Manager Additional Pay Notice, attached please find the Preliminary Special Education Case Manager Additional Pay IEP Compliance report for your school. Please review the data with designated staff and share with your case managers for clean-up prior to the pulling of the final report on Friday, December 16th at 4:00 p.m. 

 

 

The errors are as follows: 

 

●    IEP End Date column: If the date is highlighted in pink, the IEP has expired. If the date is highlighted in yellow, the IEP will expire prior to 12/16/2022. 

 

●    Case Manager column: If the cell is red, there is no active case manager listed in the Case Manager tab. 

 

●    Team Member Tab Case Manager column: If the cell is red, there is no active case manager identified in the Team Members tab. 

 

●    Case Manager Match column: If “N” appears in the column, the case manager in the Team Members tab and the Case Manager tab do not match. 

 

○    Note that these tabs are not case sensitive. If names appear to match exactly, and there is still an error, the error is most likely a space after the Case Manager name in the Case Manager Tab. To correct this, go to the Case Manager tab and delete the extra space. 

 

 

Please forward to your case managers for correction. They may view their compliance rate by referring to the Compliance column. 

 

 

Thank you, we appreciate your efforts.
